% Lines starting with a percent sign (%) are comments. LaTeX will 
% not process those lines. Similarly, everything after a percent 
% sign in a line is considered a comment. To produce a percent sign
% in the output, write \% (backslash followed by the percent sign). 
% ==================================================================
% Usage instructions:
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% The file is heavily commented so that you know what the various
% commands do. Feel free to remove any comments you don't need from
% your own copy. When redistributing the example thesis file, please
% retain all the comments for the benefit of other thesis writers! 
% ==================================================================
\pagenumbering{gobble}

% Compilation instructions: 
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Use pdflatex to compile! Input images are expected as PDF files.
% Example compilation:
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% > bibtex thesis-example
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% You need to run pdflatex multiple times so that all the cross-references
% are fixed. pdflatex will tell you if you need to re-run it (a warning
% will be issued)  
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Compilation has been tested to work in ukk.cs.hut.fi and kosh.hut.fi
% - if you have problems of missing .sty -files, then the local LaTeX
% environment does not have all the required packages installed.
% For example, when compiling in vipunen.hut.fi, you get an error that
% tikz.sty is missing - in this case you must either compile somewhere
% else, or you cannot use TikZ graphics in your thesis and must therefore
% remove or comment out the tikz package and all the tikz definitions. 
% ------------------------------------------------------------------

% General information
% ==================================================================
% Package documentation:
% 
% The comments often refer to package documentation. (Almost) all LaTeX
% packages have documentation accompanying them, so you can read the
% package documentation for further information. When a package 'xxx' is
% installed to your local LaTeX environment (the document compiles
% when you have \usepackage{xxx} and LaTeX does not complain), you can 
% find the documentation somewhere in the local LaTeX texmf directory
% hierarchy. In ukk.cs.hut.fi, this is /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist,
% and the documentation for the titlesec package (for example) can be 
% found at /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/titlesec/titlesec.pdf.
% Most often the documentation is located as a PDF file in 
% /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/xxx, where xxx is the package name; 
% however, documentation for TikZ is in
% /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/generic/pgf/pgfmanual.pdf
% (this is because TikZ is a front-end for PGF, which is meant to be a 
% generic portable graphics format for LaTeX).
% You can try to look for the package manual using the ``find'' shell
% command in Linux machines; the find databases are up-to-date at least
% in ukk.cs.hut.fi. Just type ``find xxx'', where xxx is the package
% name, and you should find a documentation file.
% Note that in some packages, the documentation is in the DVI file
% format. In this case, you can copy the DVI file to your home directory,
% and convert it to PDF with the dvipdfm command (or you can read the
% DVI file directly with a DVI viewer).
% 
% If you can't find the documentation for a package, just try Googling
% for ``latex packagename''; most often you can get a direct link to the
% package manual in PDF format.

% Document class for the thesis is report

% Font selection
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% The default LaTeX font is a very good font for rendering your

% accepted. 
% If you, however, wish to spicen up your thesis, you can try out
% these font variants by uncommenting one of the following lines
% (or by finding another font package). The fonts shown here are 
% all fonts that you could use in your thesis (not too silly). 
% Changing the font causes the layouts to shift a bit; you many
% need to manually adjust some layouts. Check the warning messages
% LaTeX gives you.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% To find another font, check out the font catalogue from
% http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/mathfonts.html
% This link points to the list of fonts that support maths, but
% that's a fairly important point for master's theses.

% Verbatim provides a standard teletype environment that renderes
% the text exactly as written in the tex file. Useful for code
% snippets (although you can also use the listings package to get
% automatic code formatting). 
\usepackage{verbatim}

% The listing package provides automatic code formatting utilities
% so that you can copy-paste code examples and have them rendered

% Layout settings
% ------------------------------------------------------------------

% When you write in English, you should use the standard LaTeX 
% paragraph formatting: paragraphs are indented, and there is no 
% space between paragraphs.
% When writing in Finnish, we often use no indentation in the
% beginning of the paragraph, and there is some space between the 
% paragraphs. 

% If you write your thesis Finnish, uncomment these lines; if 
% you write in English, leave these lines commented! 
% \setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
% \setlength{\parskip}{1ex}

% Use this to control how much space there is between each line of text.
% 1 is normal (no extra space), 1.3 is about one-half more space, and
% 1.6 is about double line spacing.  
% \linespread{1} % This is the default
% \linespread{1.3}

% Bibliography style
% acm style gives you a basic reference style. It works only with numbered
% references.
\bibliographystyle{acm}
% Plainnat is a plain style that works with both numbered and name citations.
% \bibliographystyle{plainnat}


% Extra hyphenation settings
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% You can list here all the files that are not hyphenated correctly.
% You can provide many \hyphenation commands and/or separate each word
% with a space inside a single command. Put hyphens in the places where
% a word can be hyphenated.
% Note that (by default) LaTeX will not hyphenate words that already
% have a hyphen in them (for example, if you write ``structure-modification 
% operation'', the word structure-modification will never be hyphenated).
% You need a special package to hyphenate those words.
\hyphenation{di-gi-taa-li-sta yksi-suun-tai-sta}

\thesisabstract{english}{
Global energy requirements are continuously increasing. Conventional methods of producing more energy to meet this growth pose a great threat to the environment. CO\(_{2}\) emissions and other bi-products of energy production and distribution processes have dire consequences for the environment. Efficient use of energy is one of the main tools to restrain energy consumption growth without compromising on the customers requirements. Improving energy efficiency requires understanding of the usage patterns and practices. Smart energy grids, pervasive computing, and communication technologies have enabled the stakeholders in the energy industry to collect large amounts of useful and highly granular energy usage data. This data is generated in large volumes and in a variety of different formats depending on its purpose and systems used to collect it. The volume and diversity of data also increase with time.\ All these data characteristics refer to the application of Big Data. 

This thesis focuses on harnessing the power of Big Data tools and techniques such as MapReduce and Apache Hadoop ecosystem tools to collect, process and analyse energy data and generate insights that can be used to improve energy efficiency. Furthermore, it also includes studying energy efficiency to formulate the use cases, studying Big Data technologies to present a conceptual model for an end-to-end Big Data analytics platform, implementation of a part of the conceptual model with the capacity to handle energy efficiency use cases and performing data analysis to generate useful insights.   

The analysis was performed on two data sets. The first data set contained hourly consumption of electricity consumed by a set of different buildings. The data was analysed to discover the seasonal and daily usage trends. The analysis also includes the classification of buildings on the basis of energy efficiency while observing the seasonal impacts on this classification. The analysis was used to build a model for segregating the energy inefficient buildings from energy efficient buildings. The second data set contained device level electricity consumption of various home appliances used in an apartment. This data was used to evaluate different prediction models to forecast future consumption on the basis of previous usage.
 
The main purpose of this research is to provide the basis for enabling data driven decision making in organizations working to improve energy efficiency.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Professor Matti Vartiainen and advisor Professor Jukka Nurminen for their continuous motivation, support and guidance. I would also like to give very special thanks to my instructor Ms. Sanja Scepanovic for taking keen interest in this research and providing conscientious directions throughout the process.

I would take this opportunity to highlight CIVIS project and VTT's Green Campus initiative as the main source of inspiration for my work. I would like to extend my special thanks to Mr. Janne Peltonen from VTT for his counselling and efforts in arranging the data for my research. 

Last but not the least, I would like to mention the contribution of my family as the main source of strength in my life. I am grateful for a wife who believes in me more than I do myself, the unconditional support and affection of my parents and most of all for the refreshing energy that my little fairy, Zeenia, induces in me.       

Thank you all again, and keep up the good work!
